# React Native: useRef Hook Error - Accessing Ref After Component Unmount

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications related to the `useRef` hook and asynchronous operations.  The error occurs when attempting to access a ref's current value after the component has unmounted. This typically manifests as an error indicating that a component is attempting to access a property of a component that has already been unmounted. This is because asynchronous operations like network requests, timers, or animations may complete after the component is unmounted from the DOM.

The provided code showcases the error and its solution.  The solution involves using a state variable to track the component's mounted status and only accessing the ref if the component is still mounted.
