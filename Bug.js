This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native, specifically when trying to access the current value of a ref within a function that is called after the component has unmounted.  This usually happens due to asynchronous operations like network requests or timers that continue to execute even after the component is no longer in the DOM.  When the callback finally runs, it attempts to access `myRef.current`, but the component has already been unmounted, resulting in the error.  The solution involves checking if the component is still mounted before accessing the ref.
